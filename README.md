## Tests

The project has been implemented following a TDD approach as much as possible -due of the time I had available :)-, to run tests: `go test ./...`

## Idea
This is the implementation of the [Build Your Own DNS Resolver](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-dns-resolver/) with Go, following those requirements step-by-step.
Any idea or feedback to make it better are always welcomed!
